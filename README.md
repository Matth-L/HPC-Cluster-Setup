# 🌐 HPC Cluster Deployment Project

This project aims to deploy a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster at a fictive university, providing a robust platform for research and teaching.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Deploy a high-performance, scalable HPC cluster
- Provide a robust and reliable platform for research and teaching
- Meet the needs of the university's research community
- Support a wide range of scientific and engineering applications

## 🔑 Key Components
- **Compute Nodes**: Nodes for parallel computing tasks.
- **Login Nodes**: Nodes for users to access and manage the cluster.
- **Master Nodes**: Nodes responsible for job scheduling and cluster management.
- **Service Nodes**: Nodes for additional services like file storage.
- **Router Nodes**: Nodes for high-speed communication between cluster components.
- **Network**: Infiniband HDR200 for fast and efficient data transfer.
- **Storage**: Lustre parallel file system for large datasets.

## 🛠️ Software
- **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL9)** operating system
- **Slurm** job scheduler for managing job submissions
- **GNU and Intel compiler suites** for scientific computing
- **NVIDIA CUDA toolkit** for GPU-accelerated applications
- **MATLAB and MATLAB-Engine** for mathematical computations

## 📦 Project Deliverables
- A fully functional HPC cluster
- Documentation for installation and configuration
