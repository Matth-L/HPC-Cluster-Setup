#  HPC Cluster Deployment Project

This project aims to deploy a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster at a fictive university.

## Project Goals
- Deploy a high-performance, scalable HPC cluster
- Provide a robust and reliable platform for research and teaching
- Meet the needs of the university's research community
- Support a wide range of scientific and engineering applications

## Key Components
- Compute Nodes: nodes for parallel computing tasks.
- Login Nodes: nodes for users to access and manage the cluster.
- Master Nodes: nodes responsible for job scheduling and cluster management.
- Service Nodes: nodes for additional services like file storage.
- Router Nodes: nodes for high-speed communication between cluster components.
- Network: Infiniband HDR200 for fast and efficient data transfer.
- Storage: Lustre parallel file system for large datasets.

## Software:
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL9) operating system
- Slurm job scheduler for managing job submissions
- GNU and Intel compiler suites for scientific computing
- NVIDIA CUDA toolkit for GPU-accelerated applications
- MATLAB and MATLAB-Engine for mathematical computations

## Project Deliverables
- A fully functional HPC cluster
- Documentation for installation and configuration
- User training on how to utilize the cluster effectively
